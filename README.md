# 🧬 MicroMap: High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics from H&E-stained histological images

## Overview
MicroMap is a deep generative framework for predicting high-resolution spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles directly from H&E-stained histological images. By integrating pathology foundation models with deep generative modeling, MicroMap enables accurate gene expression prediction that preserves spatial patterns and supports reliable downstream analyses such as cell type annotation, malignant region detection, and cell–cell communication inference. It offers a scalable alternative to expensive ST experiments, making spatially resolved molecular analysis more accessible for both research and clinical applications.
