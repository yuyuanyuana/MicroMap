# ðŸ§¬ MicroMap: High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics from H&E-stained histological images

## Overview
MicroMap is a deep generative framework for predicting high-resolution spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles directly from H&E-stained histological images. By integrating pathology foundation models with deep generative modeling, MicroMap enables accurate gene expression prediction that preserves spatial patterns and supports reliable downstream analyses such as cell type annotation, malignant region detection, and cellâ€“cell communication inference. It offers a scalable alternative to expensive ST experiments, making spatially resolved molecular analysis more accessible for both research and clinical applications.


## ðŸš€ Installation

### System Requirements
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 22.04
- **Python:** 3.9.21 (tested)
- **Dependencies:** See `requirements.txt` for full list. Key packages include PyTorch, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Hardware:** GPU recommended for training (tested on NVIDIA A800 80GB PCIe, Driver 550.144.03, CUDA 12.4)

### Install from GitHub
First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, install MicroMap directly from GitHub (this should only take a few seconds):

```bash
https://github.com/yuyuanyuana/MicroMap/releases/download/v1.0.0/MicroMap-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```
