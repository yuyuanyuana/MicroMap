# ðŸ§¬ MicroMap: High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics from Histology Images
MicroMap is a generalizable and cost-effective framework for predicting high-resolution spatial transcriptomic (ST) profiles directly from histological images. By integrating pathology foundation models with deep generative modeling, MicroMap enables accurate gene expression prediction that preserves spatial patterns and supports reliable downstream analyses such as cell type annotation, malignant region detection, and cellâ€“cell communication inference. It offers a scalable alternative to expensive ST experiments, making spatially resolved molecular analysis more accessible for both research and clinical applications.
